# Driver-Fatigue-Detector
 This project is a real-time fatigue detection system designed to monitor drowsiness using computer vision and facial landmark analysis. It captures a live video feed from a camera and, through facial landmark detection, monitors the user's eye-blink patterns to classify their state as "Active," "Drowsy," or "Sleeping."
